<u>3.Collecting wood</u><br><br>
I wanted to make this project with used material so i want and look for it in carpentry shop , i fond a big osb board that used to be a delivering box and i fond tree beams that used to be a pergola <br><br>

<u>4.Lets go to work :</u> <br><br>
First i saw the beams , polished and paint them,<br>
After they were dry i built the structure in the shpe like "H" so it will be strong and hold the weight, <br>
The next thing was working on the osb board sawing , polishing and spreading the varnish so it will look glossy<br><br>

Know that i had all the parts ready to be installed i did holes in the wall and fit the beams in a balanced line , first the long beams from side to side and than the small ones between them to give strength , above the "H" structure i place the osb board and checked the balance<br><br>

After that the last thing to do was making a slide door in the front of the wall to be used daily<br><br><br>
